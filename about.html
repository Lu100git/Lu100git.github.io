			<h1> WHAT MOTIVATED ME? </h1>
			<blockquote>
			It all began in 1995 I still remember the day I feel in love with computers, it was random night in 1995  I was 4 years old when my parents got a new computer with windows 95 in it, at that time, my older sister was attending an after school IT program, so she knew more than the basics, she showed me the screen and I still remember, that day as if it was yesterday, I remember she typed some commands and I was puzzled at what was happening, but there was something that caught my attention when I saw the ASCII symbols, “what does all these symbols mean, AND HOW IS THIS HAPPENING IN THE SCREEN????”, I thought, and then she said: “watch this”, as she proceeded to type cls, in the command line, and suddenly all the text was GONE!, at that very moment something sparked in me, like I needed to know how all this magic works.

			If only I attended a coder school when I was young, I could’ve built amazing things, unfortunately, when I was young I had a  boring experience on an after school IT program, the teaching was just plain and dull, and I was not interested too much into coding, but that thought was still in my mind, and I always told to myself, ”some day, I’m gonna learn how to code, and unlock all the secrets to the terminal”, and I did it.  this is why I believe is very Important, when it comes to teach kids who are interested in programming, and give them the proper guidance, so they don’t get bored, and have fun while they learn, not only they’ll be prepared for a career, but they can create new technologies in the future, by following their passion for coding, just like when I was young.
